  SPK_HULL_NERF_CS: "Hull Weakener"
  SPK_HULL_NERF_CS_DESC: "Reduces hull strength by §R25%§! in order to avoid too much hull strength resulting in the ship collapsing on itself and blinking out of existance."
  SPK_HULL_REGEN_NERF_CS: "Hull Repair Dampener"
  SPK_HULL_REGEN_NERF_CS_DESC: "Reduces hull regeneration by §R1%§! in order to prevent over eager hull repair crews from destroying said hull."
  SPK_ARMOR_NERF_CS: "Armor Density Reducer"
  SPK_ARMOR_NERF_CS_DESC: "Apparently, science has shown that armor might as well not exist when its density exceeds a certain limit. This module therefore weakens the armor by §R25%§! to prevent reaching said limit."
  SPK_ARMOR_REGEN_NERF_CS: "Armor Regenerative Dampener"
  SPK_ARMOR_REGEN_NERF_CS_DESC: "Too much armor repair can end up destroying said armor. This reduces armor repair by §R1%§! to prevent that."
  SPK_SHIELD_NERF_CS: "Shield Dampener"
  SPK_SHIELD_NERF_CS_DESC: "Apparently too much shields can be a bad thing. Like armor, shields beyond a certain stength might as well not exist. This therefore weakens the shields by §R25%§! to prevent that."
  SPK_SHIELD_REGEN_NERF_CS: "Shield Regenerative Dampener"
  SPK_SHIELD_REGEN_NERF_CS_DESC: "Attempting to recharge the shields too fast can overload them and gradually weaken them. This reduces the recharge rate by §R5%§! to prevent that happening."
